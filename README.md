# LondonRestaurantScene

This analysis has been carried out using R and the datasets provided. The analysis subject is the London restaurant scene, defined by restaurant variables such as rating, location, prices of the items on the menu and delivery times. As asked in the challenge, the analysis goes on around some business related questions provided in the challenge, plus a section of open analysis that Iâ€™ve chosen to conduct around the restaurant names, the Londoners food preferences and finally the creation of a map showing the restaurants distribution in the London area.
